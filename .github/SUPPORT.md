# Getting help with `slurmjobs`

Thank you for using `slurmjobs`!
Before filing an issue, there are few things you should know to make the process
as smooth as possible for both parties.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimally **repr**oducible **ex**ample, also known as a
'reprex'. You may use the [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) R package to
create one, though it is not necessary but it does help. It will make all of
your R-question-asking endeavors easier. Learning
[how to use it](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/learn-reprex.html) takes
about 5 to 10 minutes.

For more tips on how to make a minimally **repr**oducible **ex**ample, see this
[StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).

## Issues or Feature Requests

The best place to report issues or make feature requests is on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/slurmjobs). Before opening a new issue or feature request, be sure to
[search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/slurmjobs/issues)
to ensure that one does not already exist or has been implemented in a more recent version.

**Note**. You can remove the `is:open` search term in the issues page to search
through open and closed issues. See
[this link to learn more](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
about modifying the search.
