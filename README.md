`slurmjobs` provides helper functions for interacting with
[SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)-managed high-performance-computing
environments from R. It includes functions for creating submittable jobs
(including array jobs), monitoring partitions, and extracting info about
running or complete jobs. For details, check out the [documentation
site](http://research.libd.org/slurmjobs/).

It was developed at [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) with SLURM 22.05.9
in mind, but is intended to generalize to other clusters and newer SLURM
versions.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `slurmjobs` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/slurmjobs) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("LieberInstitute/slurmjobs")
```
